HTML is an easy language to start with if you want to get into software design or development. 

You can create a very simple webpage using only notepad. Let me show you how.

First, open up notepad or any text editor and copy the contents below into the file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Simple webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Simple Webpage</h1>
        <p>Hello World!</p>
    </body>    
</html>
```

Next, save the file as webpage.html. **Make sure to use extension html and not txt.**

Navigate to the location that the file was saved and double click the file.

Your default browser will open with the contents that we coded into the html file.
